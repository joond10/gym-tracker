It provides a user-friendly interface for users to view, edit, add, and delete workout routines for each day of the week. It offers a comprehensive solution for individuals looking to maintain a structured and efficient fitness regimen by simplifying the tracking of exercises, weight, sets, repititions and additional notes.
